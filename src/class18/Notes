4 types of Inheritance in Java
1. Single Inheritance(simple one)
    always 1 parent class and 1 child class-> Phone class(parent) -Iphone(child class)

2. Hierarchical Inheritance
    has 1 parent class and multiple child classes     -> Vehicle class(parent) -Audi, BMW , Tesla (children classes)

3. Multilevel Inheritance
    1 parent - 1 child class- multiple intermediate base classes.

4. Multiple inheritance
    two parent classes , same methods , body is different , 1 child class: diamond problem its called
    Java doesn't allow this type of inheritance

"Super" Keyword:
    By default java preference:
    1) Local variable
    2) Instance variables of the same class. -> "this"
    3) Instance variables of the parent class. -> "super"
If we want to modify this default preference, we can use "this" and "super" keywords
