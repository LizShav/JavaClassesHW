static keyword:
    Static is a keyword that can be used with variables, methods, classes etc..
    When we use this "static" keyword with a VARIABLE, that variable becomes static variable.
    When we use it with METHODS those methods become static methods.
static variables:
    Static variable can be accessed in all type of methods(instance, static).They can also
    be accessed in multiple objects of a class.
static methods:
    Static methods will have the same behaviour across all the instances of a class,
    because no instance fields are allowed inside the static methods.
Note:
    1)We can call the methods by just writing their name, if we're in the same class.
    however if we're in a different class we need to write class before the method name
    if we want to call it.

Access MODIFIERS:
    Access modifiers control the access of entities such as variables, methods, classes
    There are 4 access levels in java: 1)PRIVATE 2) PROTECTED 3) DEFAULT 4) PUBLIC
    There are 3 keywords in java that can be used to apply these access levels
PRIVATE:
    If we write "private" keyword with any variables/method/constructor etc no one else outside of that
    class can access it. The most restricted one.
DEFAULT:
    All the entities with default access can be accessed within the same class as well as in any
    other class within the same package
PROTECTED:
    will be discussed after inheritance
PUBLIC:
    If something is public, all the classes in the project can access it .
How do we decide the access level
========================================================================
1)fields/properties/instance variables=99.9% almost always they are created as private
2)methods 70 to 80% of the time are declared as public
3)98 to 99% of the time classes are declared as public
