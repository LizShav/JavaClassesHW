   ** A class is a template or a blueprint out which objects are created.
    Why should we use classes:
    1. They help us organize our code.
    2.Represent real life entities in code.
    3.Classes help us reuse code.
    Syntax:
    class ClassName{
    define field/properties/attributes here in the form of primitive and non primitive data types
    defines methods here
    }
