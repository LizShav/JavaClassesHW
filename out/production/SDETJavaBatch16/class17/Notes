Constructor:
*interview questions possible
    A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
    It is used to initialize the object with the values provided as arguments to the constructor.
    If no constructor is defined in a class, a default constructor is automatically created by Java.
Rules:
    1) Constructors must have same name as class name.
    2) Constructors don't have return types, not even void.
    if we put a return type then it'll become a method and no we should not use it
    3) when we do not create a constructor in a class , Java creates a default constructor for us
    automatically behind the scenes ex: Cat(){}. It is called default constructor.
    It does not take any parameters().

Note:    To create a constructor after instance variable declared
right click-> generate->constructor->hold shift button and arrow down to select all variables ->ok

How to we know if we should go with instance or static methods?
    Whenever we are suing instance variables in a method we must go with instance
    methods. however if you are not using any instance variables you should go
    with static.


  Task2:(hw to observe , try it )

  which takes students name and 3 subject grades.
  Inside your class also have a method to Calculate
  Average Grade. Test Student class for 5 different
  students with different marks. Your program should
