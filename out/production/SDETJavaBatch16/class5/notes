if-else:
We have a condition based on that condition we perform some tasks.
*Why should we learn about if-else conditions:
-With the help of if-else conditions we can write programs which can take decisions based on conditions.
-Syntax(Rule): if(){} ; if(*condition to put here){*code/"text" that we want to execute once the condition is true}
we can use any data type(but java converts it to boolean data type) to write this condition part with the help of relational operators such as (== != > < >= <=).
Once the codition is true ,java executes all the code that we write in {}.

Logical Operators:
-Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions.There are 3 main types of it :AND(&&) OR(||) NOT(!).These operators
work with boolean data type
*Why should we use logical operators?
The help us simplify the logic
How does the logical NOT ! works?
Logical NOT operator is used to convert a true value to a false value or a false value to a true value;
Example:
sout !true=false
boolean var1=false;
var1=!var1;
sout var1=>true;
String country="Korea";
of(!country.equals("Korea")){
sout "You are welcome"
}
Logical OR ||:
Logical OR operator helps us combine multiple conditions.
When we want to execute something as soon as one condition becomes true.
we should be using logical OR
Example:
true||true=>true
false||true=>true
true||false=>true
true||false||true=true
false||false=>false -when both conditions are false (we can have lots of conditions as long as one condition is true then it will be true

Logical AND Operators
